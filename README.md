# Description

This task demonstrates the implementation of a menu-driven file handling utility in Java, designed to perform the essential operations of reading, writing, appending, and deleting text files. It showcases the use of Java’s core I/O classes such as FileReader, BufferedReader, FileWriter, and BufferedWriter, along with structured exception handling and user input via the Scanner class.

The program presents an intuitive console interface that allows users to:

Write new content to a file or overwrite an existing one

Read and display file contents line by line

Append additional text to an existing file

Delete files permanently

Exit safely from the application

Each function is modular, robust, and error-handled to prevent runtime failures.

This project strengthens understanding of Java I/O streams, resource management, and exception handling, forming the foundation for larger applications like text editors, log analyzers, and data-storage utilities. It reflects clear code structure, readability, and interactivity—key skills for professional software development.
